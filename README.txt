The two group members for this project were Jethin Gowda and Min Hyuk (Matthew) Kim. Each group member contributed considerably to the project. Each member would usually work on a different "version" of the AI. In this way, the code base built by the previous version would be used and built upon further to continually create the algorithm. For example, Matthew created the first random AI, which Jethin then improved to make the naive heuristic AI. In total, this method of iterative improvement led each member to contribute fairly and substantially to the project.

We began with the first AI created, the random move selector. From this, we understood the basics of making moves in the first place. After this, we moved on to doing a naive heuristic, which is the greedy solution, choosing the move with the highest immediate score. After this, the heuristic was improved slightly by weighing different positions on the board as more valuable than others, such as corners or places next to corners. After this, we moved into the realm of iterative searching. We first designed an algorithm that gives a minimax of scores 2 moves deep. From this we applied the algorithm recursively to create an n ply deep searching algorithm. After this, we improved the algorithm's efficiency to make it search with a pruning algorithm. After this, we concluded that our AI was fairly competitive, as it can search good moves fairly deeply without loss of much efficiency.
